Project: Landing Page

Built an "athlete page" for my wife, who is working towards being a professional rock climber.

Happy to hear feedback / constructive criticism. Definitely still a rookie over here.

Photo credit on the bottom of the page, also here: Adam Pawlikiewicz (follow him @adamonthego) for the two large scale photos on the page. 

thx,
Connor
